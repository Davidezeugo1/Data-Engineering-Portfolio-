# Simple Extract Load and Truncate
This was my first pipeline project after my certification. THe mean idea behind this project was to write up a pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file. Load that data into a MySQL database. Then query the data from MySQL and load it into a PostgreSQL database, and then after a few minutes run a script that truncates both the MySQL and postersql database.
